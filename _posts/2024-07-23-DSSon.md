Paul Vickers and Robert HÃ¶ldrich presented _Direct Segmented Sonification_, or DSSon {% cite Vickers:2019b %} as a way of sonifying one-dimensional time series data in a temporally compressed form that picks out key features in the data.

Data was gathered from [users on the FRED machine](https://paulvickers.github.io/SoniFRED/). Below are two examples of using DSSon.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include audio.liquid path="assets/audio/DSSon_ADV_B_n.mp3" controls=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include audio.liquid path="assets/audio/DSSon_ADV_A_e.mp3" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The first example is a DSSOn of one minute of a first-time user's data. The second one is one minute of data taken from an expert user. 
</div>

The DSSon here emphasised _poor technique_, so the less sound you hear, the better the user is operating the machine.
