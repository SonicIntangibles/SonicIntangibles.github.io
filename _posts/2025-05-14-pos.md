On the 21st of May the Sonic Intangibles team (in collaboration with [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/)) are hosting an evening dedicated to sonification.
The evening is titled "The Sounds of Science" and will be held at [The Common Room](https://thecommonroom.org.uk/programme/).
Aimed at a public audience, we will will take a sonic journey through science with talks and performances that represent a broad range of fleeting physical and biological phenomena through sound â€” from distant galaxies, to brain signals and Earth cycles.
For more information please see the [event page](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/the-sounds-of-science).
