Each week the Sonic Intangibles team select a paper to read and discuss. We are starting with: 

Akkerman, S.F. and Bakker, A., 2011. Boundary crossing and boundary objects. Review of educational research, 81(2), pp.132-169. 
[DOI:10.3102/0034654311404435](https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654311404435).

It opens with the quote:
> I am conscious of myself and become myself only while revealing myself for another, through another, and with the help of another. â€¦ [E]very internal experience ends up on the boundary.
Bakhtin (1984, p. 287)
