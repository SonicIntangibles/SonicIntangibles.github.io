### Dr Christopher Harrison (Newcastle University) â€” Project Co-Lead

Chris is Reader in Astrophysics and currently holds a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship at Newcastle University, working in the [Astrophysics and Observational Cosmology](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/astro-obs/) group. He is an observational astronomer with the main goal of understanding how galaxies formed, and with a particular interest in the role of growing supermassive black holes (i.e., Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN) and galaxy dynamics. Towards this he uses a suite of observational facilities across the world (and in space!) covering the electromagnetic spectrum, to study both nearby and distant galaxies. Chris also conducts research into how sonification can be used to enhance scientific discovery, make science more accessible and make science communication more immersive. A summary of his research activities can be found on his [personal website](https://sites.google.com/view/chrisharrison/research). 

Chris has a strong interest in public engagement and accessibility to science. This includes the creation of educational exhibitions, activities and workshops, and leading international engagement projects.
