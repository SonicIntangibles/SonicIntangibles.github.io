### Dr Daniel Ratliff — Project Co-Lead

Dan is Assistant Professor of Mathematics. He is an Applied Mathematician with a small obsession on waves across physics – from the smaller polymer scales of statistical mechanics right up to waves in Near-Earth space. The running theme through everything he does is Nonlinear Waves and the PDE-based modelling associated with that. His field of expertise is water waves and hydrodynamics, but he has dabbled in many other wave systems since.
