### Rose Shepherd - PhD student

Rose Shepherd is a PhD student at Newcastle University, who is using the [STRAUSS code](https://github.com/james-trayford/strauss) to explore new methods to represent spectra (1D and 3D) and time series data. The goals are to find alternatives to visual inspection, which can be very challenging with large and complex datasets, as well as find new methods to communicate complex phenomena.
