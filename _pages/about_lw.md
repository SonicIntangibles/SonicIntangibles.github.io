### Dr Lucy Whalley (Northumbria University) â€” Project Co-Lead

Lucy is Assistant Professor of Physics. Her research uses solid state physics, quantum chemistry and high-perforance computing to investigate why particular materials can efficiently generate energy from sunlight (solar cells), or repeatedly store and release energy (rechargeable batteries). She is Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/). Lucy was previously a PhD student and post-doc in the Materials Design Group at Imperial College London, where she was awarded the Thomas Young Centre at Imperial award for here thesis "Defects and distortions in hybrid halide perovskites".

Lucy is a qualified teacher in post-compulsory education and currently teaches computational physics and research computing skills at UG and PG level. She is a topic editor at the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), and has a broader interest in how we can improve research practice in the computational sciences, with a focus on working openly and software publishing. Her research is supported by the Materials Chemistry Consortium, where she serves as a committee member.
