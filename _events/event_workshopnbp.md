## Workshop Summary

Use sound as a way to explore data through a series of creative listening and sound-making activities. 

## Event Info

Data sonification is about using sound as a way to explore data. This is used for [communicating about data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78S0lkSc7so); for [making art works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQB8XNPkL2k&t=12s); for [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0rsZiIqcbc); for [education](https://www.audiouniverse.org/education/shows/tour-of-the-solar-system) and more.  

This practical workshop will include interactive and creative tasks, listening and sound making activities, story boarding, exploring datasets, critical reflection, and group discussions. 

This workshop is for people who are interested in sound, data or collaboration, who want to find out more about how to combine these in fun and creative ways. No experience with sound or data necessary. 

Join us at 12.00 for a free vegetarian lunch. The workshop will start at 12.30 and we will provide snacks and refreshments throughout. 

### What you need?

* Computers are not needed. 

## About Sonic Intangibles

The Sonic Intangibles project, based at Northumbria and Newcastle University, is exploring how experts from different fields such as music, computer science and physics can work together to make sonifications. The research project is particularly interested in data relating to things which are too big, too small or too distant to understand using our senses or that might be hard to communicate about through traditional methods. 

We have recorded four videos so you can find out more about the Sonic Intangibles project, and how sonification might be useful for your work or projects. We recommend watching these before coming to the workshop. They can be found here: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS9GQGrzun1t8HvGf5gih5K50w67ZWvxo>. The videos have a total runtime of ~50 minutes.
